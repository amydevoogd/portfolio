			<h2>Spacebar</h2>

			<p>The energy bar industry is bursting with sweetened bars targeting athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Spacebar aims to be the rare savory bar, aimed at busy professionals, specifically working in tech.</p>

			<div class="sbcs-problem">
				<h3>The problem</h3>
				<p>I had always wondered: why the lack of savory energy bars on the market? And why do energy bars primarily target outdoorsy types or fitness junkies? Busy professionals and office workers—in particular tech workers—often work overtime on tight deadlines and don’t want to eat junk food or skip a meal.</p>

				<h4>Competitive Analysis &amp; Research</h4>

				<p>The market seems ready for a savory, nutritious alternative, given it’s strength—doubling yearly since 2015—and recent adverse publicity regarding sugar content and the nutritional value of some bars. The introduction of meat bars, such as <span>Hershey’s Krave</span> (in blueberry barbeque beef) and <span>General Mills’ Epic Bar</span> (in bison, salmon and verison) seems to bear this out. Interestingly, these newcomers aim not for the athlete, but for the average semi-active consumer.</p>

				<p>I rounded out my personas with a tangential group: busy people, such as working parents, who don’t necessarily work in an office environment but are often too busy to stop for a meal. I imagined creating subsidiary advertising campaigns targeting this group.</p>

				<h4>Branding</p></h4>
				<p>I began by brainstorming with word lists and mind-maps, flushing out obvious references and hacking into more inventive ideas, with graphic possibilities and marketing connections hovering in the wings.</p>
			</div>


			<img src="../../assets/sb-brainstorm-min.jpg">


			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<p>After many iterations and multiple surveys, the name <span>Spacebar</span> emerged as the clear choice. A keyboard’s spacebar is used to create a space, or to pause music or video, connecting with the idea of pausing and creating a space to eat. I envisioned a minimal, almost generic word mark for the logo. I incorporated the keyboard spacebar icon into the logo and played around with breaking the word in two. I searched through fonts that had a tech feel without being too obvious (such as <span>Courier</span>) and settled on <span>Orator</span>, a monospace font originally designed for the <span>IBM Selectric</span> typewriter. I selected one color, a gray similar to <span>Apple</span>’s space gray, and chose <span>Roboto</span> for a secondary typeface.</p>

			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<h4>Design</h4>
				<p>Before I began package design, I researched existing products for ingredients, texture and flavor. I sampled a dozen or so bars, and created flavor profiles based on foods both popular and nourishing, working out hypothetical ingredients for each, as well as talking points for copy. I mocked up multiple sizes and styles of packaging, deciding early on to go with a horizontal layout that mimicked the shape of a keyboard spacebar. I drew  loose vector icons that I used as a background pattern, and came up with a color palette. </p>

			</div>

			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<p>In the end the drawn icons and color seemed too much of a departure from my original generic concept, so I kept minimizing down until I settled on a white package with some simple flavor-identifying shapes.</p>

			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<h4>Development &amp; implementation</h4>
				<p>With branding and package design complete, I focused on copy, which in turn would inform my site's content areas. I invented testimonials by popular tech publications, designed a social media contest and created a tie-in with <span>Apple Watch</span>, with an app that could send alerts to users when it was time to eat. Then I sketched out rough flows that embodied these content areas which I used to render low-fidelity mockups in <span>Sketch</span>. I created an <span>Invision</span> prototype with two options and solicited feedback from fellow designers, who steered me in the direction of the more dynamic layout.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<p>After extensive image research, I dropped my assets into <span>Sketch</span> and saved them out using image compressors to minimize file size. I iterated through a few high-fidelity mock-ups and solicited critique from potential consumers and colleagues. Feedback led me to consider whether the audience for the product was clear enough—some thought I had created food for astronauts. I decided to use movement to express the brand more clearly, which I roughed out in an <span>Adobe After Effects</span> animation.</p>

			<div class="sbcs-main-copy">
				<p>Finally, I created a code guide for development. I ended up utilizing <span>Javascript</span> and the <span>Scrollmagic</span> and <span>GreenSock Animation Platform</span> libraries for the animation. Throughout production I shared my work-in-progress with colleagues who weighed in on various design and coding challenges. I also made good use of browser development tools, particularly <span>Firefox</span>’s grid inspector and responsive design mode. </p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>I was glad that I wasn’t forced to make any major design compromises during the development process, which I anticipated might happen. I did make one big shift, however—I had to abandon my original, animation design due to a miscalculation of my chosen method. Luckily, the scaled back animation was a better fit in the end. After testing the site on <span>iPhone</span>, <span>Galaxy Note</span>, <span>iPad</span> and <span>iMac</span>, I shared it with a handful of users. Here are some of their comments:</p>
