				<h3>Research + Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>The energy bar market seems ready for a savory, nutritious alternative given it’s strength—doubling yearly since 2015—and recent adverse publicity regarding the sugar content and nutritional value of some bars. The introduction of meat bars, such as <span>Hershey’s Krave</span> (in blueberry barbeque beef) and <span>General Mills’ Epic Bar</span> (in bison, salmon and venison) seems to bear this out. Interestingly, these newcomers aim not for the athlete, but for the average semi-active consumer. Additionally, consumers I surveyed pointed toward healthy ingredients (100%) and taste (81%) as top attributes for selecting bars, with fitness promise ranking significantly lower (25%).</p>

				<h3>Personas</h3>
				<p>I rounded out my personas with a tangential group: busy people, such as working parents, who don’t necessarily work in an office environment but are often too busy to stop for a meal. I imagined creating a subsidiary advertising campaign targeting this group.</p>

				<h3>Brand name</h3>
				<p>I began by brainstorming with word lists and mind-maps, flushing out obvious references and hacking into more inventive ideas, with graphic possibilities and marketing connections hovering in the wings. After multiple surveys, the name <span>Spacebar</span> emerged as the clear choice. A keyboard’s spacebar is used to create a space, or to pause music or video, connecting with the idea of pausing and creating a space to eat. </p>
			</div>

			<img src="../../assets/sb-brainstorm-min.jpg">

			<div class="sb-main-copy">
				<h3>Logo</h3>
				<p>I envisioned a minimal, almost generic word mark for the logo. I searched through fonts that had a tech feel without being too obvious and settled on <span>Orator</span>, a monospace font originally designed for the <span>IBM Selectric</span> typewriter. I selected a gray similar to <span>Apple</span>’s space gray. I used the keyboard spacebar icon and played around with breaking the word in two. I narrowed down my designs and surveyed potential consumers, 52% of which chose the logo design that closely resembles a keyboard spacebar. Finally, I chose <span>Roboto</span> for the brand's secondary typeface.</p>

				<h3>Design research</h3>
				<p>Before I began package design, I researched existing products for ingredients, texture and flavor. I sampled a dozen or so bars, and created flavor profiles based on foods both popular and nourishing, working out hypothetical ingredients for each, as well as talking points for copy.</p>

			<div class="sb-main-copy">
				<h3>Package design</h3>
				<p>I mocked up multiple sizes and styles of packaging, deciding early on to go with a horizontal layout that mimicked the shape of a keyboard spacebar. I drew  loose vector icons that I used as a background pattern, and came up with a color palette. In the end, drawn icons and color seemed too much of a departure from my original generic concept. Many iterations later I settled on a white package with simple flavor-identifying shapes.</p>

			<div class="sb-main-copy">
				<h3>Development + implementation</h3>
				<p>With branding and package design complete, I focused on copy, which in turn would inform my site's content areas. I invented testimonials by popular tech publications, designed a social media contest and created a tie-in with <span>Apple Watch</span>, with an app that could send alerts to users when it was time to eat. Then I sketched out rough flows that embodied these content areas which I used to render low-fidelity mockups in <span>Sketch</span>. I created an <span>Invision</span> prototype with two options and solicited feedback from fellow designers, who steered me in the direction of the more dynamic layout.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sb-main-copy">
				<p>After extensive image research, I dropped my assets into <span>Sketch</span> and saved them out using image compressors to minimize file size. I iterated through a few high-fidelity mock-ups and solicited critique from potential consumers and colleagues. Feedback led me to consider whether the audience for the product was clear enough—some thought I had created food for astronauts. I decided to use movement to express the brand more clearly, which I roughed out in an <span>Adobe After Effects</span> animation.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="sb-main-copy">
				<p>Finally, I created a code guide for development. I ended up utilizing <span>Javascript</span> and the <span>Scrollmagic</span> and <span>GreenSock Animation Platform</span> libraries for the animation. Throughout production I shared my work-in-progress with colleagues who weighed in on various design and coding challenges. I also made good use of browser development tools, particularly <span>Firefox</span>’s grid inspector and responsive design mode. </p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>I was glad that I wasn’t forced to make any major design compromises during the development process, which I anticipated might happen. I did make one big shift, however—I had to abandon my original, animation design due to a miscalculation of my chosen method. Luckily, the scaled back animation was a better fit in the end. After testing the site on <span>iPhone</span>, <span>Galaxy Note</span>, <span>iPad</span> and <span>iMac</span>, I shared it with a handful of users. Here are some of their comments:</p>
