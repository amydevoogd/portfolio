				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>Preliminary research helped me to determine project requirements. I found that a small percentage (3%) of the people I surveyed had used a food truck finding app, while most (70%) had used food delievery apps such as <span>GrubHub</span> or <span>UberEATS</span>. Three-quarters (75%) of respondents found an easy payment process to be the best part of using their app of choice, while almost as many (64%) complained that food menus were confusing or inaccurate.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="survey-graphic">

				<div class="survey-intro">
					<p>Since only three percent of survey respondents had ever used a food truck finding app, I scoured user reviews of existing food truck finding apps for clues as to what was working and what was not.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="survey-border-01">
					<div class="survey-quote">
						<p>Would be great if trucks could be <span>sorted by distance</span>. You have to scroll through the entire day to see what’s around and close by. <span>Show trucks by distance from my location.</span></p>
					</div>

				<div class="quoter01"><img src="../../assets/quoter01.svg"></div>
			
				<div class="survey-border-02">
					<div class="survey-quote">
						<p>When the app's information is correct it's great, but <span>a good deal of the time the information is incorrect</span>. Constantly shows trucks as open that aren't, and often doesn't list trucks that are very popular and well known.</p>

				<div class="quoter02"><img src="../../assets/quoter02.svg"></div>
				
				<div class="survey-border-03">
					<div class="survey-quote">
						<p>Features work great but there is so much more it could do. I would really like to <span>search by location and date</span>; even better would be <span>notifications</span> for which truck will be at my school the next day.</p>

				</div>

			<div class="main-copy">
				<h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
				<p>I created a SWOT matrix combining data from three of the most popular food truck finding apps. The biggest takeaway from this, in terms of design, was that an intuitive and clear flow was important.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="swot">

				<div class="internal"><h4>INTERNAL</h4></div>

				<div class="positive"><h4>POSITIVE</h4></div>

				<div class="negative"><h4>NEGATIVE</h4></div>

				<div class="external"><h4>EXTERNAL</h4></div>

				<div class="center">

					<div class="strengths">
						<h4>Strengths</h4>
						<p><span>Functionality</span> easy to use. <span>Quality</span> well-designed. <span>Experience/Expertise</span> developed through large corporation. <span>Network</span> large database, connects customers nationally. <span>Partnerships</span> event promotions create wide visibility.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="weaknesses">
						<h4>Weaknesses</h4>
						<p><span>Limited network</span> only available in select cities. <span>Accuracy</span> relies on vendor participation. <span>Design</span> not intuitive. <span>Information</span> not enough vendor detail. <span>Reputation</span> purpose ineffectively communicated due to expansive scope of company’s goals. <span>User focus</span> lack of specific target market.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="opportunities">
						<h4>Opportunities</h4>
						<p><span>Customer loyalty</span> well-positioned for growth through positive user reviews. <span>Marketing</span> large corporate backing could create lots of buzz. <span>Growing market</span> positioning as intermediary for events could broaden app’s appeal.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="threats">
						<h4>Threats</h4>
						<p><span>Timing</span> still in BETA version on Android a year plus later. <span>Focus</span> lack of attention to functionality/design could undermine success. <span>Direction</span> too broad a definition of app’s functionality may confuse users.</p>

				<h3>Personas</h3>
				<p>Personas for this project not only represented a variety of potential food truck customers, but food truck owners as well.</p>

		<section class="flows">

			<div class="main-copy">
				<h3>User stories + task flows</h3>
				<p>I wrote out numerous user stories and some basic task flows, which I then fleshed out as <span>Draw.io</span> user flow diagrams that I could refer to during design, and—ostensibly—development. </p>

				<h3>Design research</h3>
				<p>First person research involved visiting food trucks around the city, as well as downloading a dozen or so existing apps and documenting the ordering processes of each to determine features, as well as what worked and what didn’t.</p>

			<div class="main-copy">
				<h3>Sketches + lo-fi wireframes</h3>
				<p>I translated my design notes and user flow sketches created during the research phase into low-fidelity wireframes in <span>Balsamiq</span> that I used to create an <span>Invision</span> prototype that I could test with potential users. The results of those user tests informed several iterations of the flow design.</p>

				<h3>Hi-fi mockups</h3>
				<p>I designed high fidelity mockups in <span>Sketch</span> using the existing logo, color palette and typography specs that were provided. I studied and carefully followed <span>Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines</span>.</p>

				<h3>User testing</h3>
				<p>In addition to gathering feedback via <span>Typeform</span> and <span>Usabilityhub</span> surveys that I posted to <span>Reddit</span> and various <span>Slack</span> channels, I tested users in person as well. I watched as they moved through the prototype and interviewed them during the process. Several useful features came out of these conversations, such as the ability to re-order the same order, and allowing the app to alert users when their order is ready.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>I came out of this project with a real appreciation of Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines as well as Google’s Material Design system. I also realized that spontaneous feedback gathered from in-person interviews can be invaluable. Check out the <a href="https://invis.io/WYBT43PG3" target="_blank"><span>prototype</span></a>.</p>
