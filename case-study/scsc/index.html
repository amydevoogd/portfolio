				<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
				<p>During the discovery process of the project, our team identified a handful of potential competitors, some of them quite large players in the organizational survey research space. What separated our client from the competition was the target audience—companies of 500-2500 employees—and the ability to offer a high level of experience and technology without the usual pain points of money, effort and time.</p>

				<h3>Branding and Logo Design</h3>
				<p>Our mission was to design a classy and professional logo. We began brainstorming around shapes reminiscent of a compass, to convey direction and leadership, a checkmark to reflect the more literal elements of the survey process, a Mobius strip, representing the ongoing process, and finally a triangle which connected to the three-step process. We worked with a deep purple hue, a color often associated with wisdom, and a contrasting olive green, a nod to growth. The winning choice was a one-color logo whose mark combined the triangle and checkmark, paired with the businesslike <span>Copperplate</span> in two weights.</p>

				<h3>Content</h3>
				<p>Our client provided us with a large amount of written content as well as numerous charts and graphs which would inform the architecture of the site. We divided the content into logical sections and assigned a color scheme to each section. All of the icons and charts were custom drawn in a simple, relatable style. We chose a hero graphic for the home page that connected to the company’s mission of seeking to solve problems associated with people and culture.</p>

				<h3>Development + implementation</h3>
				<p>After mapping out the sitemap in <span>Balsamiq</span> we used <span>Sketch</span> to create low-fidelity wireframes that we used for a prototype that our client reviewed in <span>Pastel</span>. After a couple rounds of feedback and revisions, be built the site out in <span>WordPress</span>.</p>
