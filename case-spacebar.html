		<div class="sbcs-introcopy">

			<h2>Spacebar</h2>

			<p>The energy bar industry is bursting with sweetened bars targeting athletes and fitness enthusiasts. Spacebar aims to be the rare savory bar, aimed at busy professionals, specifically working in tech.</p>

			<div><h3>The problem</h3></div>

			<div><p>I had always wondered: why the lack of savory energy bars on the market? And why do energy bars primarily target outdoorsy types or fitness junkies? Busy professionals and office workers—in particular tech workers—often work overtime on tight deadlines and don’t want to eat junk food or skip a meal.</p></div>

			<div><h4>Competitive Analysis &amp; Research</p></h4></div>

			<div><p>The market seems ready for a savory, nutritious alternative, given it’s strength—doubling yearly since 2015—and recent adverse publicity regarding sugar content and the nutritional value of some bars. The introduction of meat bars, such as Hershey’s Krave (in blueberry barbeque beef) and General Mills’ Epic Bar (in bison, salmon and verison) seems to bear this out. Interestingly, these newcomers aim not for the athlete, but for the average semi-active consumer.</p></div>

			<div><p>I rounded out my personas with a tangential group: busy people, such as working parents, who don’t necessarily work in an office environment but are often too busy to stop for a meal.</p></div>

<!-- branding -->

			<div><h4>Branding</p></h4></div>

			<div><p>I began by brainstorming with word lists and mind-maps, flushing out obvious references and hacking into more inventive ideas, with graphic possibilities and marketing connections hovering in the wings.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-brainstorm-min.jpg">

			<div><p>After many iterations and multiple surveys, the name Spacebar emerged as the clear choice. A keyboard’s spacebar is used to create a space, or to pause music or video, connecting with the idea of pausing and creating a space to eat. I envisioned a minimal, almost generic word mark for the logo. I incorporated the keyboard spacebar icon into the logo and played around with breaking the word in two. I searched through fonts that had a tech feel without being too obvious (such as Courier) and settled on Orator, a monospace font originally designed for the IBM Selectric typewriter. I selected one color, a gray similar to Apple’s space gray, and chose Roboto for a secondary typeface.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-branding-min.jpg">

			<div><h4>Design</p></h4></div>

			<div><p>Before I began package design, I researched existing products for ingredients, texture and flavor. I sampled a dozen or so bars, and created flavor profiles based on foods both popular and nourishing, working out hypothetical ingredients for each, as well as talking points for copy.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-ingredients-min.jpg">

			<div><p>I mocked up multiple sizes and styles of packaging, settling on a foil or white horizontal bar that mimicked the shape of a keyboard spacebar. I drew some loose vector icons that I used as a background pattern. In the end I abandoned the drawn icons and color for a more spare design that uses a simple flavor-identifying shape.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-packaging-min.jpg">

			<div><h4>Development &amp; implementation</p></h4></div>

			<div><p>With branding and package design complete, I focused on copy, which in turn would inform content areas. I invented testimonials by popular tech publications, designed a social media contest and created a tie-in to Apple Watch, with an app that could send alerts to users when it was time to eat. Then I sketched out rough flows that embodied these content areas which I used to render low-fidelity mockups in Sketch. I created an Invision prototype with two options and solicited feedback from fellow designers, who steered me in the direction of the more dynamic layout.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-lofis-min.jpg">

			<div><p>After extensive image research, I dropped my assets into Sketch and saved them out using Compress JPEG and SVGOMG. I iterated through a few high-fidelity mock-ups and solicited critique from potential consumers and colleagues. Feedback led me to consider whether the audience for the product was clear enough—some thought I had created food for astronauts. I decided to use movement to express the brand more clearly, which I roughed out in an Adobe After Effects animation.</p></div>

			<img src="assets/sb-implementation-min.jpg">

			<div><p>Finally, I created a code guide for development. I ended up utilizing Javascript and the Scrollmagic and GreenSock Animation Platform libraries for the animation. Throughout production I shared my work-in-progress with colleagues who weighed in on various design and coding challenges. I also made good use of browser development tools, particularly Firefox’s grid inspector and responsive design mode. </p></div>

			<div><h3>Conclusion</p></h3></div>

			<div><p>I was glad that I wasn’t forced to make any major design compromises during the development process, which I anticipated might happen. I did make one big shift, however—I had to abandon my original, animation design due to a miscalculation of my chosen method. Luckily, the scaled back animation was a better fit in the end. After testing the site on iPhone, Galaxy Note, iPad and iMac, I shared it with a handful of users. Here are some of their comments:</p></div>

			<div><p>“Wow! This is great. The page is very clean and has great white space.”<br>-Aidan</p></div>

			<div><p>“Easy to navigate.... I like the large text with nutritional info.”<br>-Allison</p></div>

			<div><p>“Your site looks amazing. Clean design and I love what you did with the shapes!”<br>-Amanda</p></div>
